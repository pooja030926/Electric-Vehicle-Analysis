## INSIGHTS

- After analysing the sales trends, 2 wheelers e-vehicle is dominating in market as compare to the 4 wheelers e-vehicle, so we need to plan the marketing strategies to spread awareness through Auto Expo or advertisements.
- Revenue growth rate for 2022 vs 2024 contributed more profit rather than 2023 vs 2024. The reason behind this is FAME II(Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) subsidy Scheme.
- March sees the highest EV sales, while April and May are slower, so paying attention to customer behavior is essential for the business.
- CAGR  giving us a way as to how a maker is performing over a specific period of time. BYD India is outperforming other makers in CAGR.
- The 4-wheeler market is led by Tata Motors in all the quarters.
